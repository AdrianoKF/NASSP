# Format:
# Time;l/r;m/i;file-name (without .wav)
#
# The second field indicates time relative to launch or re-entry, the third whether
# it's a sound that's mandatory (always played and will slow the sim down to 1.0x if
# AUTOSLOW is specified in the scenario) or informational (only played at time
# acceleration of 1.0).
#
# Sounds must be specified in time order! If not, they're likely to play out of order or
# be ignored.
#
# Currently only launch-relative sounds are played.
