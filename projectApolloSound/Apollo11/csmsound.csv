# CSM MET-based audio files.

# Format:
# Time;l/r;0-9;file-name (without .wav)
#
# The second field indicates time relative to launch or re-entry, the third the priority
# of the sound. 9 will always be played, low values will never be played if time acceleration
# is over 1.0, and intermediate will be played at high time accelerations if AUTOSLOW is
# enabled (and will slow to 1.0).
#
# Sounds must be specified in time order! If not, they're likely to play out of order or
# be ignored.
#
# Currently only launch-relative sounds are played.
