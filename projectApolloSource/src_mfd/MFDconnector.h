  **************************** Revision History ****************************
  *	$Log$
  *	Revision 1.2  2009/09/17 17:48:41  tschachim
  *	DSKY support and enhancements of ChecklistMFD / ChecklistController
  *	
  *	Revision 1.1  2009/02/18 23:21:34  tschachim
  *	Moved files as proposed by Artlav.
  *	
  *	Revision 1.12  2008/05/24 17:30:40  tschachim
  *	Bugfixes, new flash toggle.
  *	
  *	Revision 1.11  2008/01/25 20:06:06  lassombra
  *	Implemented delayable switch functions.
  *	
  *	Now, all register functions on all toggle switches should take, at the end, a boolean
  *	 for whether it is delayable, and an int for how many seconds to delay.
  *	
  *	Actual delay can be anywhere between the int and the int + 1.
  *	
  *	Function is implemented as a timestepped switch which is called intelligently from
  *	 the panel, which now gets a timestep call.
  *	
  *	Revision 1.10  2008/01/23 01:40:07  lassombra
  *	Implemented timestep functions and event management
  *	
  *	Events for Saturns are now fully implemented
  *	
  *	Removed all hardcoded checklists from Saturns.
  *	
  *	Automatic Checklists are coded into an excel file.
  *	
  *	Added function to get the name of the active checklist.
  *	
  *	ChecklistController is now 100% ready for Saturn.
  *	
  *	Revision 1.9  2008/01/16 19:03:02  lassombra
  *	All but time-step, automation, and complete save/load is now implemented on the Checklist Controller (and the files that depend on it).
  *	
  *	All bugs in current code should hopefully be gone, but not necessarily so.
  *	
  *	Revision 1.8  2008/01/15 19:13:05  lassombra
  *	Implemented Vessel connector and Checklist Completion step.  The third button down on the left side completes the "current" step on the temporary MFD.
  *	
  *	Additionally made dummy checklists reference "Mission Timer Switch" so that the flashing function can be tested.
  *	
  *	Finally, updated the MFD demo to show one way to do a flashing switch, and a recommended deconstructor implementation.
  *	
  *	Revision 1.7  2008/01/15 17:43:59  lassombra
  *	Allows multiple senders to attach to a single receiver.
  *	
  *	Revision 1.6  2008/01/14 15:52:34  lassombra
  *	*Final* version of the interface for the checklist controller.  May need some more
  *	 data, but should be accessible at this point.  For some reason getting heap errors
  *	 in deconstructors, doing research into it.
  *	
  *	Revision 1.5  2008/01/09 09:39:06  lassombra
  *	Completed MFD<->ChecklistController interface.  Coding can now take place on two separate code paths.
  *	
  *	Anyone who wants to work on the MFD can at this point do so using the existing connector code.
  *	
  *	None of the functions will exactly DO anything at the moment, but that is being worked on.
  *	
  *	Revision 1.4  2008/01/09 01:46:45  movieman523
  *	Added initial support for talking to checklist controller from MFD.
  *	
  *	Revision 1.3  2007/12/21 02:47:08  movieman523
  *	Connector cleanup, and fix my build break!
  *	
  *	Revision 1.2  2007/12/21 02:31:17  movieman523
  *	Added SetState() call and some more documentation.
  *	
  *	Revision 1.1  2007/12/21 01:00:30  movieman523
  *	Really basic Checklist MFD based on Project Apollo MFD, along with the various support functions required to make it work.
  *
