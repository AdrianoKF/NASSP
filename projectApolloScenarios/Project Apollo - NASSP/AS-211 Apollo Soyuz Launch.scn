First Take off with Soyuz19 From Baikonur.
Once in orbit, you only have to wait your flight path to cross Cape Canaveral.
Launch from the Cape to Rendez-Vous with Soyuz 19 awaiting in orbit.
Turn heading 45° for lift off to join soyuz excentred orbit (passing over Baikonur).
Separate stage and dock with ASTP module. then Rendez vous with soyuz.
This time no Fake Space Station, Just use Align instrument with the soyuz ship. When you're close to SOyuz use Attitude MFD for final Approach.
A complete challenge.
Real rendez vous took place after 2 days passing over Metz (North-East of France).
