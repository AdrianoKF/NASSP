Introducing SKYLAB

Skylab mesh are provided by John Graves (Missleman01)

Skylab does use a dedicated Saturn V vehicle, from the early satrun V stock for the Moon project.

In Orbiter terms, SKYLAB Nassp has its own dll based on NASSP 4.2 saturn V Class.

 - What's different ???

THis saturn V has only engine on 1st stage and 2nd stage, Skylab weight 76 Tons and the SVIB-SLA-LEM-CSM package weight 175 Tons.
With 100 tons less, the Saturn is able to achieve the 424x439 orbit with 2nd stage.

Obviously, the autopilot code as required some adaptations.

Apollo panel has been unwired from the vehicle...

So here are some keys :

J Jettison the 2nd Stage once in orbit (engine has to be shut down)

K "Deploy" Skylab panel (no animations yet I'm afraid)

P Toggle autopilot.

Once launched, you may use it for Skylab mission, the provided scenario has setup a saturn1B Apollo on pad to rendez vous with skylab
