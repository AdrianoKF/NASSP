          <p>To do a realistic rollout without sinking into the launch pads we use Artlav's great Meshland plugin, which provides collision detection with surface base meshes.</p>
          <p>Please note that the Meshland integration is still under development, in the next release we plan to bundle it with Project Apollo - NASSP for easy installation, at the moment please follow the instructions below:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Install (or update to) the latest beta release of Project Apollo - NASSP including the &quot;Meshland Pack&quot;. You'll find detailed instructions here: <a href="http://nassp.sf.net/user/betatesting.html">http://nassp.sf.net/user/betatesting.html</a>.
                <p>             
            </li>
            <li>Start Orbiter, go to the &quot;Modules&quot; tab and activate the &quot;MeshLand&quot; module.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>That all, now you can try assemby and rollout as explained below.

    <h3>The Crawler Transporter</h3>
    <p>The Crawler Transporter (CT) is the most important vessel during rollout and prelaunch. It's used to move the Saturn on the Mobile Launcher (ML) from the VAB to the launch pad (and back, if necessary). The Crawler Transporter is also used to move the Mobile Service Structure (MSS) from it's parking position to the pad and back. </p>
    <p>The Crawler Transporter is controlled by the following keys:</p>

    <h3>Rollout</h3>
    <p>Of course you can do the rollout after you assembled the Saturn completely, but you can also start with the rollout directly. To do that please start the &quot;2. Apollo 11 - Rollout&quot; scenario in the &quot;Project Apollo - NASSP\Apollo - Historical Missions\Apollo 11&quot; folder. <span class="postbody">The scenario starts one day before launch, the crawler is parking in front of the VAB with the Saturn on the ML inside. </span></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open the VAB high bay door by pressing &quot;1&quot; on the normal part of the kexboard (not numpad). It takes a few minutes until the door is fully open.
      <p></li>
      <li>Then you have to change the driving direction of the Crawler Transporter, then move the CT under the ML, stop and attach the ML. You can attach the ML when you are close enough and stopped. 
      <p></li>
      <li>Now again change driving direction and drive to the pad. Since the CT is quite slow especially with the ML attached, so use time acceleration if you don't want to wait.<p></li>
      <li>If you're close enough to the launch pad and stopped you can detach the ML, the Saturn is now in launch position. You can reattach the ML with the Saturn until 3 hours before launch, after that's the Saturn is fuelled (you'll notice the fuel vents) and cannot be moved any more.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp; </p>
    <h3>The Mobile Service Structure</h3>
    <table width="100%"  border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="3">
      <tr>
        <td valign="top"><p><span class="postbody">After the rollout the Mobile Service Structure (MSS) was moved to the pad for final works on the Saturn and moved back to parking position before launch. In Project Apollo - NASSP it's not necessary for the launch to use the MSS, but if you want to do it like the real thing, you'll hopefully like it. </span></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Drive the Crawler Transporter back to the MSS parking position, then move the CT under the MSS, stop and attach the MSS. You can attach the MSS when you are close enough and stopped.
                <p>            
            </li>
            <li>Now again change driving direction and drive to the pad. Since the CT is quite slow especially with the MSS attached, so use time acceleration if you don't want to wait.</li>
          </ul>          </td>
        <td align="right" valign="top"><img src="../images/mss.jpg" border="0"></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <ul>
      <li>If you're close enough to the launch pad and stopped you can detach the MSS. Now you can drive the crawler back to parking position. But before launch you should come back, attach the MSS when you're close enough and stopped and move the MSS back to parking position. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h3>Prelaunch and Liftoff</h3>
    <p>The automatic prelaunch sequence of the ML and the LUT (Launch <font size="-1">Umbilical</font> Tower) starts 3 hours before launch with moving the Hammerhead Crane to launch position.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>At T-43min (that means 43 min before launch) the Crew Access Arm is moved to park position.</li>
      <li>At T-5min the Crew Access Arm is fully retracted.</li>
      <li>At T-30s the S-IC Intertank Arm is retracted. </li>
      <li>At T-16.2s the  S-IC Forward Arm is retracted.</li>
      <li>At T-0s the remaining swingarms and the service masts are retracted, LIFTOFF!</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
