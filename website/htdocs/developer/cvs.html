    <p>This introduction tries to provide step-by-step instructions to the Project Apollo CVS repository at SourceForge. It's no comprehensive introduction to CVS or SourceForge. For further informations please use the following links:</p>

	<p>We recommend TortoiseCVS as client, so first of all please download and install it. You will find the current version here: <a href="http://www.tortoisecvs.org">http://www.tortoisecvs.org</a>.
	You will also find some instructions especially for SourceForge in the TortoiseCVS help. We also recommend to take the time to read the &quot;Using TortoiseCVS with SourceForge&quot; chapter and the &quot;Using Pageant to avoid having to enter the SSH password every time&quot; chapter in the help file and to use Pageant. </p>

So please make a login for yourself and post an informal request with your login (UNIX name) included that you wants to be added at the Project Apollo Forum (<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/mscorbit/phpBB2/index.php">http://www.ibiblio.org/mscorbit/phpBB2/index.php</a>).</p></td></tr></table>

	<p>If you use CVS the first time you can practice the basic CVS operations with the test module (named &quot;test&quot;). Do the checkout as explained below, but use &quot;test&quot; as module. You'll get some test files you can change as you like to get familiar with CVS. </p>
	<h3>Initial Checkout </h3>
	<p>After
	  installing please do the following steps to build your "development enviroment" for Project Apollo:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Make a new, empty folder on your local harddisc, you can choose the location and the name of the new folder
		as you like, in the following it is assumed that the folder is &quot;C:\ProjectApollo&quot;.<p></li>
		<li>Right-click the new folder in your Windows Explorer and choose "CVS Checkout..." from the context menu.<p></li>
		<li>Enter the following settings in the "Checkout Module" window:
			<ul type="square">
				<li>Protocol: Secure Shell (:ext:)</li>
				<li>Server: cvs.sourceforge.net</li>
				<li>Repository folder: /cvsroot/nassp</li>
				<li>User name: &lt;YourUNIXName&gt;</li>
				<li>Module: projectApollo</li>
			</ul><p>
			After that your CVSROOT should look like this:<p>
			<b>:ext:&lt;YourUNIXName&gt;@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/nassp</b><p>
			whereas &lt;YourUNIXName&gt; is your SourceForge login. All settings are case-sensitive!
		 <p></li>
		 <li>Press "OK". TortoiseCVS downloads now the current version of the Project Apollo sources to your computer. This will take some time...<p></li>
		 <li>After the checkout install Orbiter in your folder, that means in the example above the path of Orbiter is &quot;C:\ProjectApollo\orbiter.exe&quot;.
		 This includes the following files at the moment:
		 <p>Orbiter (<a href="http://www.orbitersim.com">http://www.orbitersim.com</a>)
		 <ul type="square">
		 <li>orbiter050116_base.zip
        </li><li>orbiter050116_htex.zip
        </li><li>orbiter050116_sdk.zip <p>
        </li><li>orbiter050216patch_base.zip
        </li><li>orbiter050216patch_sdk.zip</li></ul>
		<p>OrbiterSound (<a href="http://orbiter.dansteph.com">http://orbiter.dansteph.com</a>)
		<ul type="square">
		 <li>OrbiterSound30.exe </li></ul>
		<p>Orbiter and OrbiterSound should not overwrite any of the CVS files.
		<p>
		 </li>
		 <li>To develop you will find the Project Apollo workspace file for Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 in the  &quot;ProjectApollo&quot; source folder (&quot;C:\ProjectApollo\Orbitersdk\samples\ProjectApollo\ProjectApollo.dsw&quot;). All available projects are included in this workspace. Since there are no modules in the repository first you have to compile the sources (or install them from the file release).
		 The projects should have a clean debug and release configuration, please try if you can work with them WITHOUT
changing them and please report problems to an administrator or at the forum, we'll try to help you as soon as possible.<p></li>
<li>That all, now you can try if Orbiter and Project Apollo is running normally. You'll find the proper scenarios in the &quot;Project Apollo - NASSP&quot; scenario folder. </li>
    </ul>
	<h3>Edit a file</h3>
	<p>To change a file you first have to do a CVS Edit with the file (by choosing  &quot;CVS Edit&quot; in the Tortoise context menu). After that the file is no longer read only and the CVS server knows that you are editing the file. You can check which files are edited by other users (or by yourself) with the &quot;Show edited files...&quot; in the Tortoise context menu.</p>
	<h3>Commit your changes</h3>
	<p>When you finished changing a file you can commit it (save it) to the CVS repository by choosing the &quot;CVS Commit...&quot; context menu item. Please provide a useful comment in the commit window. If the committed file is a source file, your comment will be added to the revision history at the top of the file.</p>
	<p>If you don't want to commit your changes (and undo it) please choose &quot;CVS Unedit&quot; instead.</p>
	<h3>Update your local files</h3>
	<p>To get the changes of the other users you don't have to do the checkout again (in fact you must not) but you have to use the &quot;CVS Update&quot; feature:</p>
	<p> Choose the &quot;CVS Update&quot; menu item from the Tortoise context menu for each folder below &quot;C:\ProjectApollo&quot;, i.e. &quot;Config&quot;, &quot;Doc&quot;, &quot;Html&quot; etc. CVS will download the changed files and merge the changes into your local copies.</p>
	<p>If you receive an update of a file you are editing at the moment it can happen that merging is not possible and you get a &quot;confict&quot;. If you have problems resolving the confict please contact a project administrator for assistants, this is always a difficult situation.</p>
	<h3>Comments and remarks</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>There is no NEP support at the moment so please do NOT install NEP in your development folder (and of course no other add-on).<p></li>
	<li>Do NOT rename or delete any folder name or CVS will go mad. Be very carefully when you add a directory to the repository because you cannot delete it.
	  <p></li>
	<li>There are lot's of .cvsignore files so CVS should ignore Orbiter files and the VC++ files created during build, I hope everthing works fine but there could be bugs of course.
<p></li><li>If you have problems or need help please mail to an administrator, an other developer or post in the forum and we will help you to solve your problem.</li>
