APOLLO 7 VIRTUAL AGC SCENARIO CHECKLIST v1.2
--------------------------------------------

This checklist/flightplan is an ongoing work, evolving over the course of time as new features of NASSP are developed. For the time being, the mission can be flown, from beginning to end, using the currently documented features of the Virtual AGC. This checklist/flightplan is not absolute for all functions and maneuvers, and will require the following tools:

1. CHRISTOPHE'S EARTH ORBIT CALCULATOR, SET TO PARAMETERS USED FOR APOLLO 7, TITLED "APOLLO 7 EOCA"
2. A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE CMC UPDATE SPREADSHEET, TITLED "APOLLO 7 CMC UPDATE"
3. (OPTIONALLY) SCHNECI'S APOLLO TELEMETRY MFD

As more features for NASSP/Apollo 7 are developed, this checklist/flightplan will expand as well. One key feature left out of the checklist/tutorial that is still in development is the historical rendezvous with the SIVB booster stage in the early portion of the mission.

This checklist/flightplan does not include any verification of switch settings unless otherwise specified. Because of this, be certain that you are careful not to miss any switch settings or steps listed in the procedures. Some may not have much purpose at the moment and will pose little or no harm if missed, while others can and will cause adverse effects to the mission if overlooked, so be careful, and quicksave before each procedure.

I would like to express that this has been tested extensively and thoroughly from beginning to end, some portions of the mission more than others, with no problems as long as it is followed correctly. Results of maneuvers will vary from mission to mission and from user to user, but this spreadsheet should hopefully help to keep your Apollo 7 experience as historically correct as possible.

CREDITS:
--------
I would personally like to thank:

The entire Project Apollo Development Team and Beta Testers for devoting their time and effort, and making the dream of flying and Apollo Mission a reality for everyone.

Christophe, for allowing me to test his amazing Earth Orbit Calculator, and the many hours he spent developing it, as well as the procedures documented and explained by him, the NASSP development team, and the good ole' NASA engineers, much of which was needed to make this flightplan possible.

Schneci, for developing the ApolloTelemetry MFD, which makes state vector updates a breeze.

And finally Martin Schweiger, for developing Orbiter, and making virtual spaceflight a free reality to the public.

Thanks, and have a great time flying Apollo 7!
