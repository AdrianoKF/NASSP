# Descent stage batteries. Numbers are POWER (in watt-seconds), VOLTAGE, INTERNAL RESISTANCE
# These are 415 AH batteries. 12,450 watt-hours, or 44,820,000 watt-seconds.
# The original number was 40,320,000
# 30 volts was the actual on-load max voltage of the battery. The real open-circuit voltage was higher.
# CHANGING THESE NUMBERS INVALIDATES SAVED SCENARIOS!
